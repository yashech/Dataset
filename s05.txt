__label__2	There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid
__label__2	Nothing here seems as funny as it did in Analyze This , not even Joe Viterelli as De Niro 's right-hand goombah .
__label__5	Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of John Pogue , the Yale grad who previously gave us `` The Skulls '' and last year 's `` Rollerball . ''
__label__1	Enough said , except : Film overboard !
__label__2	Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .
__label__2	This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
__label__3	The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
__label__2	On its own , it 's not very interesting .
__label__1	As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .
__label__1	It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
__label__3	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
__label__1	As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .
__label__3	The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .
__label__1	The rest of the film ... is dudsville .
__label__1	Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and I know this because I 've seen ` jackass : the movie . '
__label__2	The criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...
__label__2	The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .
__label__1	Killing time , that 's all that 's going on here .
__label__3	Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
__label__2	The action clich√©s just pile up .
__label__2	Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .
__label__2	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
__label__2	Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s American sports movie .
__label__1	Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .
__label__1	Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
__label__3	... if you 're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch Freaks as a matinee .
__label__3	Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary .
__label__3	Though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , Jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .
__label__3	There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
__label__1	The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
__label__3	Analyze That regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film 's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
__label__2	With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .
__label__2	Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
__label__1	To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .
__label__2	Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .
__label__1	The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... It 's a pity that ( Nelson 's ) achievement does n't match his ambition .
__label__3	When Seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , I wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , ` Hey , Kool-Aid ! '
__label__3	An easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .
__label__2	Imagine the CleanFlicks version of ` Love Story , ' with Ali MacGraw 's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .
__label__2	PC stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .
__label__2	Forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?
__label__2	An odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
__label__2	Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
__label__2	Pascale Bailly 's rom-com provides Am√©lie 's Audrey Tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i.e. , a banal spiritual quest .
__label__3	A static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .
__label__4	Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .
__label__3	Almost .
__label__2	... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
__label__3	The Country Bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers .
__label__2	Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
__label__1	The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to Stonehenge .
__label__1	Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end .
__label__1	The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
__label__2	Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .
__label__3	Only in its final surprising shots does Rabbit-Proof Fence find the authority it 's looking for .
__label__2	Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it .
__label__1	... plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going .
__label__1	In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .
__label__2	Maybe LeBlanc thought , `` Hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . ''
__label__1	What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .
__label__3	Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time
__label__1	The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
__label__3	So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
__label__1	I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
__label__3	If Sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over .
__label__2	Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
__label__2	There 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening .
__label__1	`` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker .
__label__3	A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .
__label__3	Takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny .
__label__2	The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers .
__label__1	Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
__label__3	Sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! )
__label__1	is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House .
__label__1	Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
__label__2	Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .
__label__3	With this new Rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .
__label__2	One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman 's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2002 's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
__label__1	A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
__label__2	Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .
__label__4	But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
__label__2	The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
__label__2	A portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .
__label__2	The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .
__label__1	Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD .
__label__2	Feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
__label__2	Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
__label__4	Can you bear the laughter ?
__label__3	Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
__label__2	There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .
__label__2	Beware the quirky Brit-com .
__label__4	They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .
__label__4	Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .
__label__2	The gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .
__label__1	Completely awful Iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
__label__2	Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .
__label__2	There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .
__label__3	Directors John Musker and Ron Clements , the team behind The Little Mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they are n't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
__label__2	Adam Sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
__label__3	There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .
__label__2	Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .
__label__3	It 's all pretty tame .
__label__1	The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
__label__2	The movie is a mess from start to finish .
__label__2	The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
__label__3	I 'm not saying that Ice Age does n't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there 's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
__label__3	In the telling of a story largely untold , Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .
__label__1	The plot is nothing but boilerplate clich√©s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
__label__1	Terminally brain dead production .
__label__2	Some episodes work , some do n't .
__label__4	Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
__label__4	J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .
__label__2	Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
__label__1	Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
__label__4	Wow .
__label__1	I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
__label__2	Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .
__label__1	It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
__label__3	Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .
__label__1	It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
__label__1	Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
__label__3	The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .
__label__2	The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
__label__1	There 's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever .
__label__2	None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
__label__2	A processed comedy chop suey .
__label__3	As spent screen series go , Star Trek : Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there 's nothing to drink .
__label__1	Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .
__label__2	Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .
__label__1	An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
__label__2	The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
__label__2	With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
__label__1	If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
__label__3	The director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of New Age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing .
__label__3	Everything is pegged into the groove of a New York dating comedy with ` issues ' to simplify .
__label__2	A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff .
__label__3	The cameo-packed , M : I-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything .
__label__3	It comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if BA , Murdock and rest of the A-Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .
__label__1	The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
__label__4	So genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen .
__label__3	It never is , not fully .
__label__2	Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
__label__2	What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
__label__1	As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer ( Jeremy Renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
__label__2	Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .
__label__4	The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
__label__3	Oozes condescension from every pore .
__label__1	`` Solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .
__label__2	The direction , by George Hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .
__label__4	Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
__label__4	It has plenty of laughs .
__label__3	It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
__label__1	An awful lot like one of ( Spears ' ) music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
__label__1	Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .
__label__2	( H ) ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang , I 'd want something a bit more complex than We Were Soldiers to be remembered by .
__label__2	Occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
__label__3	it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like My Big Fat Greek Wedding
__label__1	By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
__label__1	Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
__label__2	Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
__label__4	At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .
__label__3	At its worst , it 's Rambo - meets-John Ford .
__label__3	Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .
__label__2	This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
