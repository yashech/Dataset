__label__2	A generic international version of a typical American horror film .
__label__2	... while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of Shakespeare 's Macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention .
__label__2	Lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s .
__label__3	There 's a lot of good material here , but there 's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .
__label__1	Absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man 's navel .
__label__4	If you think it 's a riot to see Rob Schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy The Hot Chick .
__label__1	The sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .
__label__4	Strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
__label__3	The next big thing 's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut .
__label__2	Yet another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ...
__label__3	Bond-inspired ?
__label__3	Certainly .
__label__4	Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ?
__label__3	Let 's hope not .
__label__1	This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
__label__3	Davis has energy , but she does n't bother to make her heroine 's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
__label__2	Surprisingly , considering that Baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy .
__label__1	None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .
__label__1	... a bland murder-on-campus yawner .
__label__1	A humorless journey into a philosophical void .
__label__3	These two are generating about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory poised to receive a UN inspector .
__label__2	Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation .
__label__3	A passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .
__label__2	The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
__label__2	shows Holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
__label__2	Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
__label__3	It 's just a little too self-satisfied .
__label__3	Clever but not especially compelling .
__label__1	McKay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .
__label__2	A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
__label__3	LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
__label__2	The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
__label__1	The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .
__label__4	Alarms for Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
__label__2	What little grace ( Rifkin 's ) tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .
__label__1	Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .
__label__1	Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .
__label__1	... what a banal bore the preachy Circuit turns out to be
__label__2	Falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice .
__label__1	A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences .

__label__3	No big hairy deal .
__label__1	The issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care .
__label__2	Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .
__label__3	The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare .
__label__1	` This movie sucks . '
__label__2	None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .
__label__4	A few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are n't likely to enter the theater .
__label__3	Bad in such a bizarre way that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .
__label__2	There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
__label__4	Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
__label__1	Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
__label__2	I 've had more interesting -- and , dare I say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .
__label__3	What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .
__label__1	The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
__label__2	When a movie asks you to feel sorry for Mick Jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it .
__label__1	There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .
__label__2	... hokey art house pretension .
__label__1	... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
__label__2	Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .
__label__1	Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
__label__1	This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
__label__2	A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside Danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the Bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative .
__label__3	Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .
__label__1	The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .
__label__2	Silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .
__label__3	There is so much plodding sensitivity .
__label__2	The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
__label__2	... too sappy for its own good .
__label__3	Circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets .
__label__5	As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .
__label__2	As the Mediterranean sparkles , ` Swept Away ' sinks .
__label__2	Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .
__label__5	Half Past Dead is just such an achievement .
__label__3	Expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished .
__label__2	It all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer .
__label__3	( Javier Bardem is ) one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director Gerardo Vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
__label__2	Feels shrill , simple and soapy .
__label__2	Adults , other than the parents ... will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild .
__label__3	Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable .
__label__2	In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , The Emperor 's Club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .
__label__2	No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas .
__label__3	A direct-to-void release , heading nowhere .
__label__2	Typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like Saturday morning TV in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .
__label__1	Below is well below expectations .
__label__3	At no point during K-19 : The Widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot .
__label__4	... standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added .
__label__2	Empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .
__label__1	It does n't work as either .
__label__1	Given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .
__label__3	Possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure .
__label__4	It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose .
__label__4	Jonathan Parker 's Bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .
__label__2	There may have been a good film in `` Trouble Every Day , '' but it is not what is on the screen .
__label__2	Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .
__label__3	Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
__label__2	There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
__label__3	The Master of Disguise is funny -- not `` ha ha '' funny , `` dead circus performer '' funny .
__label__2	And for all the wrong reasons besides .
__label__2	A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .
__label__1	A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .
__label__2	You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .
__label__1	The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .
__label__2	With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
__label__3	It 's the type of stunt the Academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .
__label__2	In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
__label__2	So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
__label__3	The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .
__label__2	If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably would n't be too crazy with his great-grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .
__label__1	Sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50 .
__label__2	Weirdly , Broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .
__label__3	Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .
__label__4	eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .
__label__4	A showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor Michel Serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
__label__3	Boy oh boy , it 's a howler .
__label__2	A few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks .
__label__1	The thing just never gets off the ground .
__label__2	... contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
__label__2	The actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face .
__label__1	Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
__label__3	The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .
__label__3	However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
__label__2	There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
__label__2	The Tuxedo was n't just bad ; it was , as my friend David Cross would call it , ` Hungry-Man portions of bad ' .
__label__2	Blue Crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be .
__label__2	The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
__label__3	While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's Animal House .
__label__1	So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .
__label__3	Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
__label__3	An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .
__label__5	Woody Allen has really found his groove these days .
__label__1	The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
__label__3	The bland outweighs the nifty , and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
__label__2	It 's such a mechanical endeavor ( that ) it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .
__label__5	The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .
__label__2	If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
__label__2	Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .
__label__2	Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
__label__2	A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .
__label__2	A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .
__label__2	Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .
__label__2	A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
__label__2	Human Nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart .
__label__4	A film with a great premise but only a great premise .
__label__2	Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
__label__1	Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .
__label__3	( Kirshner wins , but it 's close . )
__label__1	A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .
__label__3	What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence .
__label__1	( Sam 's ) self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
__label__1	An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
__label__2	Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .
__label__2	The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
__label__1	This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
__label__2	Too silly to take seriously .
__label__3	The inevitable double - and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .
__label__2	Everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .
__label__4	I like it .
__label__1	No , I hate it .
__label__4	No , I love it ... hell , I dunno .
__label__1	This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
__label__1	It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
__label__1	A fifty car pileup of cliches .
__label__1	It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
__label__1	Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
__label__1	What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
__label__4	As an actor 's showcase , Hart 's War has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player .
__label__2	As a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired .
__label__2	A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .
__label__3	It 's not hateful .
__label__1	It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
__label__3	Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
__label__1	The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .
__label__2	A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .
__label__1	The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
__label__2	Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .
__label__2	Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .
__label__2	Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .
__label__1	A markedly inactive film , City is conversational bordering on confessional .
__label__3	While kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .
__label__2	Despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from Kathryn Bigelow , The Weight of Water is oppressively heavy .
__label__1	We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .
__label__1	They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .
__label__3	They were right .
__label__1	It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
__label__1	Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
__label__2	Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .
__label__2	Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
__label__1	A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
__label__1	Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
__label__3	Too ordinary to restore ( Harmon ) to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .
__label__3	Stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of Ghost and Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
__label__2	The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
__label__1	It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
__label__2	Contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .
__label__4	It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
__label__2	It still feels like a prison stretch .
__label__1	Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
__label__3	Ong chooses to present Ah Na 's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character 's blank-faced optimism .
__label__2	The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''
__label__2	Just a Kiss is a just a waste .
__label__1	... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
__label__1	Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .
__label__1	And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .
__label__2	As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .
__label__2	A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .
__label__2	This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
__label__3	It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades .
__label__2	There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
__label__3	The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .
__label__3	As happily glib and vicious as its characters .
__label__1	One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
__label__2	No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .
__label__1	( MacDowell ) ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .
__label__2	I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .
__label__1	Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
__label__3	Kurys never shows why , of all the period 's volatile romantic lives , Sand and Musset are worth particular attention .
__label__3	Almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited .
__label__2	And in a sense , that 's a liability .
__label__2	It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
__label__2	If you 've got a house full of tots -- do n't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .
__label__2	The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . '
__label__3	Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original .
__label__2	If I want music , I 'll buy the soundtrack .
__label__2	If I want a real movie , I 'll buy the Criterion DVD .
__label__3	An unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title .
__label__3	Has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together .
__label__2	Writer-director Stephen Gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the English call ` too clever by half . '
__label__1	Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .
__label__1	The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
__label__1	An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
__label__3	The name says it all .
__label__1	Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .
__label__4	Children , Christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of Jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , Catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .
__label__2	Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
__label__2	... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .
__label__2	With Zoe Clarke-Williams 's lackluster thriller `` New Best Friend '' , who needs enemies ?
__label__2	Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .
__label__2	Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
__label__2	An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
__label__3	aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there 's little to be learned from watching ` Comedian '
__label__3	A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .
__label__2	The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .
__label__1	The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
__label__2	The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
__label__1	Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .
__label__1	As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .
__label__1	I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .
__label__2	There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .
__label__3	The Emperor 's Club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but ...
__label__2	In the end , The Weight of Water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on Showtime 's ` Red Shoe Diaries . '
__label__2	A straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
__label__2	Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .
__label__2	The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
__label__2	Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?
__label__2	Once again , director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .
__label__2	Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .
__label__2	Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .
__label__3	A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog .
__label__2	The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since Roland Joffé and Demi Moore 's The Scarlet Letter .
__label__3	The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .
__label__3	As a movie , it never seems fresh and vital .
__label__2	It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
__label__2	It labours as storytelling .
__label__1	The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a whole lot of nada .
__label__2	A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .
__label__2	Lawrence should stick to his day job .
__label__4	He 's a better actor than a standup comedian .
__label__1	Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie
__label__4	A well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .
__label__2	I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !
__label__4	A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .
__label__1	Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .
__label__1	We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
__label__2	The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
__label__2	Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .
__label__2	Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .
__label__2	Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .
__label__2	At best , Cletis Tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .
__label__2	Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .
__label__2	Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
__label__1	As plain and pedestrian as catsup --
__label__4	An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it .

__label__2	Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .
__label__2	Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
__label__2	Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would .
__label__3	The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
__label__3	Charlize CHASES Kevin with a GUN .

__label__1	Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .
__label__3	Consider this review life-affirming .
__label__3	If the movie were all comedy , it might work better .

__label__3	The movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it .
__label__2	Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .

__label__1	The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
__label__5	Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans .
__label__1	But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .
__label__4	Too clever by about nine-tenths .
__label__2	Has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children 's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .
__label__2	Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .
__label__2	Toward the end Sum of All Fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .
__label__4	Director Carl Franklin , so crisp and economical in One False Move , bogs down in genre cliches here .
__label__2	Mendes still does n't quite know how to fill a frame .
__label__2	Like the Hanks character , he 's a slow study : The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed .
__label__1	This thing is just garbage .
__label__3	As crimes go , writer-director Michael Kalesniko 's How to Kill Your Neighbor 's Dog is slight but unendurable .
__label__1	There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
__label__4	A bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .
__label__3	An uplifting , largely bogus story .
__label__2	An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .
__label__2	If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors ( Dawson Leery did what ?!? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .
__label__1	My own minority report is that it stinks .

__label__1	... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .
__label__2	While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .
__label__2	With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
__label__2	( Davis ) wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .
__label__2	Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .

__label__3	Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .
__label__3	The photographer 's show-don ` t-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
__label__1	It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
__label__2	I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .
__label__1	Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
__label__3	meanders between its powerful moments .
__label__1	What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .
__label__2	A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
__label__3	Pure of intention and passably diverting , His Secret Life is light , innocuous and unremarkable .
__label__3	... delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story .
__label__1	Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .
__label__2	It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .
__label__2	Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
__label__1	A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .

__label__2	( T ) oo many of these gross out scenes ...
__label__2	About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .
__label__2	Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .
__label__3	Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .
__label__3	If Jews were Catholics , this would be Catechism
__label__2	One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
__label__4	The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .
__label__3	It 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling .
__label__3	Charming , if overly complicated ...
__label__3	Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression .
__label__3	All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .
__label__1	It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
__label__3	Hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does n't .

__label__1	After you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .
__label__3	Not one moment in the enterprise did n't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow .
__label__2	In the era of The Sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .

__label__2	Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .
__label__3	There 's no question that Epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .

__label__1	At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .
__label__2	... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
__label__2	A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .
__label__2	The characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
__label__2	Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .
__label__4	Not the Great American Comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too .
