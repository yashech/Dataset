__label__3	Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .
__label__1	All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness .
__label__3	The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .
__label__1	... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .

__label__1	If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .
__label__2	An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .
__label__2	What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
__label__2	The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .
__label__1	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
__label__2	Nevertheless , it still seems endless .
__label__1	It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !
__label__2	It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good .

__label__2	Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
__label__2	It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .
__label__1	The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .
__label__1	Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
__label__2	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .

__label__2	Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .

__label__1	It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .
__label__2	Rosenthal ( Halloween II ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .
__label__2	Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .

__label__3	Rob Schneider , Dana Carvey and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Philadelphia Story ?
__label__2	David Spade as Citizen Kane ?
__label__3	Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center .
__label__2	The problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .
__label__2	It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .
__label__2	Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .
__label__1	On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .
__label__2	I ca n't say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
__label__2	It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
__label__2	After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .
__label__3	We get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle .
__label__3	Summer 's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .
__label__2	The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
__label__2	Often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns What Time Is It There ?
__label__2	into How Long Is This Movie ?
__label__2	Too bad Kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up .
__label__2	Deuces Wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like The Wanderers and A Bronx Tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
__label__1	It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .
__label__1	Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .
__label__3	It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .
__label__1	A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
__label__2	An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
__label__2	Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .
__label__2	This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
__label__2	These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .
__label__2	The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .
__label__2	Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .
__label__3	The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... ( but ) from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .
__label__2	... built on the premise that middle-class Arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids .
__label__1	A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .
__label__3	The sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .
__label__2	Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .
__label__4	A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .

__label__3	A little objectivity could have gone a long way .
__label__1	One of the worst films of 2002 .
__label__3	I believe Silberling had the best intentions here , but he just does n't have the restraint to fully realize them .
__label__2	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
__label__2	McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
__label__2	High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government / Marine/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
__label__1	This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .
__label__2	The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .
__label__1	This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
__label__1	An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
__label__1	The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .
__label__1	Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
__label__2	The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .
__label__2	I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
__label__2	The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other .
__label__2	The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .
__label__2	Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .
__label__2	After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
__label__2	` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... '
__label__1	A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .
__label__3	Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
__label__1	If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .
__label__2	It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
__label__2	Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
__label__2	The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
__label__1	A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
__label__1	Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
__label__2	Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .
__label__2	( The film 's ) taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .
__label__4	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
__label__3	If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .
__label__3	Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
__label__1	Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
__label__2	Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .
__label__3	It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
__label__3	Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .
__label__3	The camera whirls !

__label__3	Wow , a jump cut !
__label__2	Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
__label__1	The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
__label__2	It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
__label__4	It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
__label__2	Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .
__label__5	Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
__label__4	( Gayton 's script ) telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
__label__2	Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
__label__1	A ragbag of cliches .
__label__3	This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .
__label__1	The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
__label__1	It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
__label__1	This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .
__label__4	Short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .

__label__2	Just send it to Cranky .
__label__1	We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
__label__2	An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .
__label__2	The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad .
__label__2	The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .
__label__3	The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .
__label__2	No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
__label__1	Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .

__label__2	Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .
__label__1	This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
__label__1	The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again .
__label__3	Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .
__label__2	Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
__label__2	Every joke is repeated at least four times .
__label__2	Every joke is repeated at least four times .
__label__2	Every joke is repeated at least -- annoying , is n't it ?
__label__2	Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
__label__2	The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
__label__2	Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
__label__1	( Creates ) the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
__label__1	The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .

__label__2	Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .
__label__2	They cheapen the overall effect .
__label__2	Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .
__label__2	An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .
__label__3	( Allen 's ) been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .
__label__1	An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
__label__2	Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
__label__1	The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
__label__2	Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .
__label__2	The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
__label__3	Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .
__label__1	The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
__label__2	More a gunfest than a Rock concert .
__label__1	It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
__label__2	A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .
__label__1	It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
__label__2	It 's not original enough .
__label__1	A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
__label__3	Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games .
__label__1	A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
__label__2	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
__label__1	An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
__label__1	The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
__label__2	Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
__label__1	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
__label__3	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .
__label__3	For free .
__label__1	I still want my money back .
__label__2	It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
__label__3	It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
__label__2	All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .
__label__3	... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .
__label__3	Strictly middle of the road .
__label__2	Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
__label__2	After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
__label__2	No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .
__label__2	A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
__label__1	With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
__label__3	`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .
__label__3	A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .
__label__3	Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy .
__label__2	Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .
__label__2	Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
__label__2	Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .
__label__3	A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
__label__2	The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) .
__label__2	Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
__label__1	Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
__label__1	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
__label__3	How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of ( François and Michèle 's ) relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .
__label__2	They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
__label__1	Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
__label__1	The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld ( who is also one of the film 's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .
__label__2	Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
__label__1	Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
__label__1	The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
__label__2	Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
__label__3	Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .
__label__2	Enigma lacks it .
__label__2	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
__label__3	... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .
__label__2	A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
__label__1	Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
__label__2	In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
__label__2	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .
__label__1	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
__label__2	Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
__label__3	New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...
__label__2	Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
__label__2	Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
__label__2	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
__label__3	A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .
__label__2	Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .
__label__3	But , no , we get another scene , and then another .
__label__1	You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
__label__3	An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
__label__2	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
__label__2	The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
__label__1	Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
__label__2	Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
__label__3	Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
__label__3	Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .
__label__2	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
__label__3	For a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire ?
__label__2	lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
__label__2	Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .
__label__2	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .
__label__2	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .
__label__3	It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
__label__4	Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
__label__2	For every articulate player , such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman , are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence .
__label__2	There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .
__label__2	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
__label__2	It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
__label__4	I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
__label__2	I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
__label__2	Dreary tale of middle-class angst
__label__2	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
__label__2	( Jackson and Bledel ) seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .
__label__3	Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks , but not anyone else .
__label__2	Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
__label__1	An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
__label__3	( Screenwriter ) Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .
__label__2	It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
__label__2	Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .
__label__3	Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
__label__3	A decidedly mixed bag .
__label__1	There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
__label__2	Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .
__label__3	Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .
__label__2	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
__label__3	Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .
__label__1	Just dreadful .
__label__1	I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
__label__2	Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of ( Witherspoon 's ) better films .
__label__2	hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
__label__1	This is just lazy writing .
__label__2	Even kids deserve better .
__label__2	The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .
__label__2	And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .
__label__3	Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .
__label__3	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .
__label__4	Frank Capra played this story straight .
__label__1	But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .
__label__3	How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?
__label__1	The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
__label__5	Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .
__label__1	Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé .
__label__1	`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
__label__2	A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
__label__2	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
__label__3	It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .
__label__3	An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher is n't , however , is original .
__label__4	Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
__label__1	Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .
__label__4	Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
__label__2	Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
__label__2	All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .
__label__1	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
__label__3	I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .
__label__2	But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
__label__2	Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .
__label__1	What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
__label__1	Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .
__label__2	Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
__label__3	Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .
__label__1	None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .
__label__2	The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .
__label__1	` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '
__label__2	At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
__label__2	The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .
__label__2	While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .
__label__1	A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .
__label__3	What 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle ?
__label__3	Well , it 's not as pathetic as The Animal .
__label__2	With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .
__label__2	The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .
__label__2	What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel .
__label__2	Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .
__label__2	With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
__label__4	It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
__label__1	Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
__label__3	Mandel Holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning .
__label__1	You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
__label__1	A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
__label__2	Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
__label__2	Seriously , rent the Disney version .
__label__1	As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .
__label__4	Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .
__label__3	It ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to .
__label__1	`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
__label__2	Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .
__label__4	A live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .
__label__2	A loquacious and dreary piece of business .
__label__2	What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean .
__label__1	director Hoffman , his writer and Kline 's agent should serve detention
__label__3	Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
__label__4	Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .
__label__2	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
__label__1	I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
__label__3	While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .
__label__1	I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
__label__2	The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .
__label__3	Whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
__label__2	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
__label__1	The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
__label__2	If routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $ 8 and get ready for the big shear .
__label__1	This is one baaaaaaaaad movie .
__label__5	A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .
__label__3	He may have meant the Internet short Saving Ryan 's Privates .
__label__2	But Windtalkers does n't beat that one , either .
__label__2	May puzzle his most ardent fans .
__label__2	Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
__label__2	We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .
__label__3	Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .
__label__3	Ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose Madonna .
__label__3	The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .
__label__2	Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
__label__2	While you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out `` When you 're a Jet , you 're a Jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` Tonight . ''
__label__1	The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
__label__2	... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . '
__label__1	More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
__label__2	TV skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .
__label__2	( Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are ) sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .
__label__2	If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .
__label__1	It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .
__label__2	Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .
__label__2	Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .
__label__2	Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .
__label__3	This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
__label__3	Feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class .
__label__1	Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .
__label__1	Vulgar is too optimistic a title .
__label__3	The actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect .
__label__2	The characters never change .
__label__2	If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
__label__4	Welles groupie/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst .
__label__2	Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .
__label__1	Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...
__label__1	A bad movie that happened to good actors .
__label__2	Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
__label__4	Screenwriter Dan Schneider and director Shawn Levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite .
__label__1	Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
__label__1	That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .
__label__2	It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .
__label__1	Rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning .
__label__2	If you saw Benigni 's Pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
__label__3	The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
__label__3	The pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting .
__label__2	Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .
__label__2	Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .
__label__2	In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .
__label__2	( T ) he ideas of Revolution # 9 are more compelling than the execution
__label__2	The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side .
__label__2	What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
__label__2	Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .
__label__2	Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
__label__2	Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .
__label__2	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .
__label__4	Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
__label__2	All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .
__label__2	( A ) stale retread of the '53 original .
__label__2	One thing 's for sure -- if George Romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .
__label__1	For dance completists only .
__label__1	Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
__label__2	It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .
__label__2	The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
__label__3	Yo , it 's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo .
__label__1	I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .
__label__1	This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .
__label__1	Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .
__label__2	Hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
__label__2	Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane .
__label__2	Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders .
__label__1	The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
__label__2	Low comedy does n't come much lower .
__label__2	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .
__label__1	It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
__label__2	One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .
__label__2	This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .
__label__3	Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears .
__label__1	A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
__label__2	An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .
__label__1	The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
__label__2	The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
__label__1	Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .
__label__2	A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special .
__label__3	I ca n't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail .
__label__2	... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .
__label__2	Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .
__label__2	One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before .
__label__2	Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .
__label__2	The film 's most improbable feat ?

__label__2	A Movie to Forget

__label__2	It looks good , but it is essentially empty .
__label__2	The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .

__label__3	Hollywood 's answer to an air ball .

__label__2	Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .

__label__1	This is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .
__label__2	There 's some outrageously creative action in The Transporter ... ( b ) ut by the time Frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman .

__label__2	Yet another genre exercise , Gangster No. 1 is as generic as its title .
__label__3	Despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair ...

__label__3	Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .

__label__1	Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .

__label__2	So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .
__label__2	A disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate IMAX trip .
__label__3	Does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of Richard Nixon .
__label__2	This Sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama .
__label__2	He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .
__label__2	The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 / 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .
__label__1	It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''
__label__3	In a strange way , Egoyan has done too much .
__label__3	He 's worked too hard on this movie .
__label__2	The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
__label__3	The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .
__label__2	A clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film ...
__label__2	The movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity .
__label__2	What we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .
__label__1	The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
__label__2	A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing .
__label__2	To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
__label__1	This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
__label__2	It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
__label__2	Scotland , PA is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept .
__label__2	A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita .
__label__2	Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .
__label__2	There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
__label__3	It 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There 's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .
__label__1	The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
__label__1	Sorority Boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .
__label__2	Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming .
__label__2	Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .
__label__3	This is the first film I 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .
__label__3	Fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
__label__3	Weiss and Speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .
__label__1	Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
__label__2	Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .
__label__2	The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
__label__1	Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
__label__1	It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
__label__4	It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
__label__2	Make Chan 's action sequences boring .

__label__3	It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .
__label__2	The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .
__label__2	The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
__label__1	I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
__label__2	Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .
__label__1	Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
__label__3	A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .
__label__1	Get out your pooper-scoopers .
__label__4	While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .
__label__2	It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
__label__1	Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony .
__label__2	More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .
__label__3	There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .
__label__2	It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .
__label__2	It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .
__label__3	The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped !
__label__3	-- was a fad that had long since vanished .
__label__2	It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 ) to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
__label__2	Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
__label__2	The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .
__label__4	more precious than perspicacious
__label__2	If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
__label__2	( T ) he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate Bela Lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent .
__label__1	If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .
__label__4	Enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise .
__label__2	Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .
__label__3	Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .
__label__2	Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
__label__4	While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics ) , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .
__label__3	It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .
__label__3	Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs .
__label__2	Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .
__label__3	Nor is it a romantic comedy .
__label__3	Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf .
__label__2	Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
__label__3	It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
__label__2	In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .
__label__2	Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
__label__2	The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
__label__2	Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .
__label__1	It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
__label__1	Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
__label__3	Snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good .
__label__2	Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .
__label__1	Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
__label__2	Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
__label__2	It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made ( Eyre 's ) first film something of a sleeper success .
__label__3	The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .
__label__2	A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
__label__3	All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
__label__2	Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
__label__1	There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
__label__2	The story is predictable , the jokes are typical Sandler fare , and the romance with Ryder is puzzling .
__label__3	Wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .
__label__2	Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .

__label__2	Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .
__label__2	Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
__label__2	A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
__label__1	An empty , purposeless exercise .
__label__3	Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .
__label__1	Haneke 's script ( from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
__label__2	A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
__label__2	Those 24-and-unders looking for their own Caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
__label__2	A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .
__label__2	What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .
__label__3	Ultimately , Jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with .
__label__2	Ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over .
__label__2	It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf .
__label__3	Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .
__label__3	When the precise nature of Matthew 's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .
__label__1	This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your ABC 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
__label__3	Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .
__label__4	If you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with The Salton Sea .
__label__1	A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
__label__2	The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
__label__2	This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
__label__3	A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .
__label__3	Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .
__label__2	The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .
__label__2	Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .
__label__2	A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .
__label__3	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .
__label__3	( It ) highlights not so much the crime lord 's messianic bent , but Spacey 's .
__label__1	Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .
__label__2	A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .

__label__2	A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
__label__4	Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget .
__label__2	But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .
__label__4	Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
__label__2	It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
__label__2	Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .
__label__4	This is a children 's film in the truest sense .
__label__5	It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .
__label__3	Parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil
__label__3	The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .
__label__1	Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
__label__3	Ice Age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .
__label__2	Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .
__label__2	Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '
__label__1	What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .
__label__2	A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .
__label__2	The movie is without intent .
__label__3	Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .
__label__2	While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
__label__2	If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke , Lucky Break is ( Cattaneo ) sophomore slump .
__label__2	Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
__label__2	Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
__label__1	You expect more from director Michael Apted ( Enigma ) and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan ( Reversal of Fortune ) than this cliche pileup .
__label__2	The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?
__label__2	The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
__label__2	Replacing John Carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage .
__label__1	Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .
__label__2	It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .
__label__2	Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
__label__1	... feels as if ( there 's ) a choke leash around your neck so director Nick Cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something .
