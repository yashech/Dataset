__label__2	Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .
__label__3	The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .
__label__3	Has its charming quirks and its dull spots .
__label__2	An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of Don Simpson .
__label__2	The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
__label__2	Everyone 's to blame here .
__label__2	You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .
__label__2	Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
__label__2	Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .
__label__3	It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .
__label__3	A slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise .
__label__3	Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness .
__label__2	But what is missing from it all is a moral .
__label__3	What is the filmmakers ' point ?
__label__2	Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
__label__3	You see Robin Williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm .
__label__1	You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
__label__1	Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .
__label__1	The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
__label__2	Formulaic to the 51st power , more like .
__label__3	Draggin ' about dragons
__label__2	Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject .
__label__3	A respectable but uninspired thriller that 's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact .
__label__3	Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .
__label__3	The movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .
__label__2	Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
__label__2	Offers absolutely nothing I had n't already seen .
__label__1	`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
__label__3	You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible .
__label__2	Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
__label__2	Complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold .
__label__4	First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
__label__1	... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .
__label__1	Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .
__label__2	Could as easily have been called ` Under Siege 3 : In Alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .
__label__1	In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .
__label__2	Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .
__label__3	Slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot .
__label__1	The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
__label__4	Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss .
__label__2	But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
__label__2	In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .
__label__1	This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
__label__2	The film is flat .
__label__2	The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable .
__label__3	It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
__label__2	An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .
__label__1	The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .
__label__2	Do we really need the Tiger Beat version ?
__label__2	This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .
__label__2	The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
__label__2	When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .
__label__3	It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
__label__2	The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .
__label__3	Anemic chronicle of money grubbing New Yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups .
__label__3	Simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .
__label__2	An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .
__label__2	Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .
__label__2	This toothless Dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
__label__1	It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .
__label__3	Oh , and Booty Call .
__label__2	Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .
__label__2	It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
__label__2	Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .
__label__3	Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .
__label__1	A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
__label__1	The movie has a script ( by Paul Pender ) made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
__label__1	A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
__label__2	At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
__label__2	Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
__label__2	Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work .
__label__2	What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
__label__2	Schneidermeister ... Makin ' a fool of himself ... Losin ' his fan base ...
__label__3	An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
__label__2	Not once does it come close to being exciting .
__label__3	A Frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , Bartleby performs neither one very well .
__label__3	It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .
__label__3	There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .
__label__3	And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser .
__label__1	One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .
__label__2	Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance .
__label__3	The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .
__label__2	It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
__label__2	I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .
__label__2	Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
__label__3	So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .
__label__2	The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
__label__3	Some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .
__label__2	It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .
__label__2	Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` Scooby ' do n't .
__label__2	A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .
__label__3	For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 2 is still a no brainer .
__label__2	If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .
__label__2	Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
__label__2	Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .
__label__2	Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .
__label__2	This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .
__label__2	The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
__label__2	A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
__label__2	A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
__label__3	Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .
__label__2	We hate ( Madonna ) within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .
__label__2	Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , ( Ahola ) has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .
__label__2	Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
__label__3	A fascinating but choppy documentary .
__label__1	Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
__label__3	The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .
__label__2	And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
__label__2	Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .
__label__2	Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
__label__1	The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
__label__2	Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .
__label__3	Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .
__label__3	... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .
__label__2	Never comes together as a coherent whole .
__label__2	An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .
__label__2	First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
__label__2	And second , what 's with all the shooting ?
__label__1	Do n't even bother to rent this on video .
__label__2	There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .
__label__1	This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .
__label__1	Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
__label__2	Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
__label__1	The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
__label__2	A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .
__label__2	An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .
__label__3	Bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .
__label__3	Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .
__label__2	The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
__label__3	Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
__label__2	A film that suffers because of its many excesses .
__label__2	Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
__label__2	In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .
__label__2	But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .
__label__1	Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .
__label__2	Nijinsky says , ' I know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too .
__label__2	` CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
__label__1	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
__label__2	... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
__label__2	Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
__label__1	It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) .
__label__2	This action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
__label__1	MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
__label__2	That 's because relatively nothing happens .
__label__1	No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
__label__2	Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
__label__2	Boyd 's screenplay ( co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .
__label__2	There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
__label__2	Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
__label__2	A moving picture that does not move .
__label__3	Ruh-roh !
__label__2	Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !
__label__2	Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .
__label__1	I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .
__label__2	` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
__label__1	... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
__label__2	Is it a comedy ?
__label__3	A drama ?
__label__3	A romance ?
__label__2	A cartoon ?
__label__3	Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .
__label__3	Did the film inform and educate me ?
__label__4	Yes .
__label__3	Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia ?
__label__2	No. .
__label__2	And that is where Ararat went astray .
__label__2	It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
__label__2	Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .
__label__2	Eight Legged Freaks wo n't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love ...
__label__2	It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
__label__2	Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
__label__1	Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
__label__2	A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
__label__1	Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
__label__2	Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .
__label__2	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
__label__2	The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
__label__2	Average , at best , I 'm afraid .
__label__2	This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .
__label__3	A crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing .
__label__1	This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
__label__3	Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .
__label__2	Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .
__label__1	In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
__label__2	The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . ''
__label__1	It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
__label__2	The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
__label__2	Worthy of the gong .
__label__2	While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .
__label__2	I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
__label__2	The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
__label__2	The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .
__label__2	As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
__label__1	Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
__label__2	Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .
__label__4	It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
__label__1	Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .
__label__3	Oops , she 's really done it this time .
__label__1	That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
__label__1	It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
__label__1	A chiller resolutely without chills .
__label__2	For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .
__label__2	The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
__label__1	`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
__label__2	Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .
__label__4	Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
__label__2	The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
__label__3	The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but Ram Dass : Fierce Grace does n't organize it with any particular insight .
__label__2	Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .
__label__2	It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
__label__1	Merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
__label__2	If you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
__label__3	Traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill .
__label__2	The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
__label__1	... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
__label__3	I wish Windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story .
__label__2	This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .
__label__2	Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .
__label__5	Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
__label__2	None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
__label__3	As social exposé , Skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on .
__label__1	The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
__label__3	There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
__label__1	The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
__label__3	This one is certainly well-meaning , but it 's also simple-minded and contrived .
__label__4	Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .
__label__1	Bad and baffling from the get-go .
__label__2	A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
__label__2	At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .
__label__3	The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .
__label__3	A well-acted movie that simply does n't gel .
__label__1	Like a can of 2-day old Coke .
__label__2	You can taste it , but there 's no fizz .
__label__2	There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
__label__3	Both the crime story and the love story are unusual .
__label__2	But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .
__label__2	It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
__label__1	Other than a mildly engaging central romance , Hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .
__label__2	Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
__label__2	Outside of Burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken
__label__3	Was I scared ?
__label__3	Only at the prospect of Beck 's next project .
__label__2	Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... Ghost Blimp ?
__label__2	A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
__label__1	By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
__label__3	Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !
__label__3	True Hollywood Story .
__label__2	Wes Craven 's presence is felt ; not the Craven of ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' or ` The Hills Have Eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` Deadly Friend . '
__label__3	Sunshine State surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology .
__label__2	But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .
__label__2	It 's one long bore .
__label__2	It gets old quickly .
__label__2	Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .
__label__2	It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .
__label__2	... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .
__label__2	Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .
__label__1	The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
__label__2	It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
__label__2	We just do n't really care too much about this love story .
__label__1	In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
__label__2	The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
__label__2	Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...
__label__3	` Men in Black II creates a new threat for the MIB , but recycles the same premise .
__label__4	Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride .
__label__2	But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .
__label__2	Feels familiar and tired .
__label__2	A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .
__label__1	Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture
__label__4	Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .
__label__2	A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
__label__1	A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
__label__1	It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
__label__1	Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
__label__1	Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
__label__2	An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .
__label__1	Horrible .
__label__1	The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .
__label__4	Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting Love Hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .
__label__2	An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .
__label__1	Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .
__label__2	As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , ( Franco ) has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .
__label__1	The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
__label__1	It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
__label__2	` Synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .
__label__2	It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .
__label__2	Impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .
__label__2	Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .
__label__2	The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .

__label__2	A standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for De Niro 's participation , would have likely wound up a TNT Original .
__label__2	Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .

__label__3	I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
__label__1	It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
__label__2	This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
__label__3	Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain .
__label__2	But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
__label__4	Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .

__label__2	An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .

__label__3	`` What John does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .
__label__2	Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .
__label__2	Its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
__label__1	Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .
__label__2	Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge .
__label__1	Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .

__label__2	If religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away .

__label__2	Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .
__label__2	It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .

__label__3	One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .
__label__2	Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .
__label__2	The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in ( the characters ' ) misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .
__label__2	This dubious product of a college-spawned ( Colgate U. ) comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .
__label__2	The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
__label__3	Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers/Abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers .

__label__1	After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
__label__3	Made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because ( Solondz 's ) cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .
__label__4	As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .

__label__2	With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .
__label__2	Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break .

__label__3	You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .
__label__2	Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .

__label__1	The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .

__label__2	The Santa Clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry .

__label__4	-- but certainly hard to hate .
__label__2	A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .
__label__3	It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .

__label__2	The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .
__label__4	The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .
__label__3	Ca n't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ?

__label__2	Patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .

__label__1	So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
__label__1	One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .
__label__1	Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever .
__label__5	He has a great cast and a great idea .
__label__3	But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .
__label__3	... generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish .
__label__2	It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .

__label__1	Ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills .

__label__1	` It 's painful to watch Witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Abomination , I mean , Alabama . '
__label__1	A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
__label__2	Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .
__label__2	Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .

__label__2	A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .
__label__2	While it is welcome to see a Chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , Lan Yu never catches dramatic fire .
__label__2	The script boasts some tart TV-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .
__label__3	Despite the pyrotechnics , Narc is strictly by the book .
__label__3	In both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .
__label__3	You end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .
__label__3	Cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .
__label__3	Worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades .

__label__2	One suspects that Craven endorses They simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .

__label__3	Do n't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .
__label__1	The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .

__label__2	Spain 's greatest star wattage does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .
__label__2	Conforms itself with creating a game of ` who 's who ' ... where the characters ' moves are often more predictable than their consequences .
__label__2	Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .
__label__2	The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
__label__2	Suffers from all the excesses of the genre .
__label__2	The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
__label__1	The latest Adam Sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .
__label__4	Downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message .
__label__2	While the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .
__label__2	They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .
__label__3	It 's harmless , diverting fluff .
__label__1	But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
__label__2	It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .
__label__3	Comedy troupe Broken Lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot .
__label__2	Pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of God in the fifth Trek flick .
__label__2	A horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
__label__2	It 's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt .
__label__3	` All in all , Reign of Fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
__label__3	Occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring .
__label__1	A movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end .
__label__1	The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
__label__3	Who are ` they ' ?
__label__3	Well , they 're ` they ' .
__label__2	They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .
__label__3	They exist for hushed lines like `` They 're back ! ''
__label__4	, `` They 're out there ! ''
__label__3	and `` They 're coming ! ''
__label__2	Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .
__label__2	Were Dylan Thomas alive to witness first-time director Ethan Hawke 's strained Chelsea Walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Theatre . '

__label__2	I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , I do n't see the point .
__label__1	It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .

__label__2	Clare Peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little American Pie-like irreverence .

__label__2	Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .
__label__2	A perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .
__label__2	The adventure does n't contain half the excitement of Balto , or quarter the fun of Toy Story 2 .
__label__4	Essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty .
__label__2	A mess .

__label__2	The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
__label__4	Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .
__label__5	Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh 's best films , `` Erin Brockovich , '' `` Out of Sight '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven , '' never were .
__label__2	Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
__label__2	In the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director Roger Kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags .
__label__3	You can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer .
__label__1	Thumbs down .
__label__1	The characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite James Bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as The Usual Suspects .
__label__2	... del Toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy .
__label__2	The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .
__label__3	The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? '
__label__3	but ` Why ? '
__label__4	Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .
__label__2	A movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts .
__label__4	A movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment . '
__label__3	Occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story .
__label__1	If we 're to slap protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she 's French , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ?
__label__3	Moretti plays Giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy .
__label__2	Too predictably , in fact .
__label__2	Alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but Ayurveda does the field no favors .

__label__3	Arnie blows things up .
__label__3	Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ?
__label__1	An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .
__label__3	... they missed the boat .
__label__2	More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
__label__2	Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
__label__2	The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .

__label__2	Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
__label__3	It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
__label__3	The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .
__label__2	Nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .
__label__4	A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .
__label__2	The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .

__label__4	Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! )
__label__3	into Scrooge .
__label__2	Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
__label__2	Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !
__label__2	is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .
__label__1	May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
__label__2	There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .
__label__1	Where 's the movie here ?
__label__3	A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .
__label__2	Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
__label__2	Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .
__label__1	Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block .
__label__2	Although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .
__label__1	It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
__label__2	In the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like `` Girl in Bar # 3 . ''
__label__2	... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired .
__label__4	I 'm guessing the director is a magician .
__label__2	After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
__label__2	An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .
__label__1	In its own way , Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buñuel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
__label__1	an appalling ` Ace Ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak , former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton .
__label__2	If any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ...
__label__1	The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
__label__2	Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .
__label__1	... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
__label__4	Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .
__label__2	Both deserve better .
__label__2	-- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .
__label__1	Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
__label__2	I do n't think so .
__label__2	Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
__label__2	Not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .
__label__1	Another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .
__label__2	A battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .
__label__1	The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
__label__2	What 's worse is that Pelosi knows it .
__label__2	... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .
__label__2	If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''
__label__1	or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
__label__1	The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
__label__2	The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict .
__label__2	First-time director João Pedro Rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .
__label__1	`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .
__label__2	` Unfaithful ' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory .
__label__2	Too bad .
__label__1	Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
__label__2	Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .
__label__3	`` Juwanna Mann ? ''
__label__2	No thanks .
__label__2	Wewannour money back , actually .
__label__3	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
__label__1	Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
__label__2	Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
__label__2	The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .
__label__2	Any rock pile will do for a set .
__label__1	Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
__label__3	Britney 's performance can not be faulted .
__label__2	Lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .
__label__2	I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
__label__1	It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
__label__2	Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
__label__1	A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
__label__1	The movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks .
__label__3	Pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .
__label__1	Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .
__label__1	... has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
__label__2	It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
__label__2	Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .
__label__2	At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it
__label__1	... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
__label__1	A DOA dud from frame one .
__label__2	Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
__label__4	There are plenty of scenes in Frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .
__label__2	Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .
__label__3	The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .
__label__2	First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course .
__label__1	Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .
__label__2	Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .
__label__2	The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
__label__1	A predictable , manipulative stinker .
__label__2	The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
__label__3	Eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath .
__label__4	It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
__label__1	The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
__label__2	It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating .
__label__4	An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
__label__1	once she lets her love depraved leads meet , ( Denis ' ) story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
__label__3	The dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically .
__label__3	The people in ABC Africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .
__label__2	What 's really sad is to see two Academy Award winning actresses ( and one Academy Award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's TV sitcom material at best .
__label__4	No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
__label__2	Where their heads were is anyone 's guess .
__label__2	Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .
__label__1	A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
__label__4	Got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2 - hour , dissipated length .
__label__2	A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .
__label__2	Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .
__label__1	I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
__label__1	Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
__label__2	Feels less like a change in ( Herzog 's ) personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .
__label__1	One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
__label__2	Will anyone who is n't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ?
__label__2	A selection of scenes in search of a movie .
__label__2	( Janey ) forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .
__label__2	Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
__label__1	True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
__label__2	( Evans is ) a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .
__label__1	The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
__label__3	You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .
__label__1	Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .
__label__1	A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
__label__1	Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
__label__1	As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .
__label__2	Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .
__label__2	Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
__label__2	The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .
__label__2	While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .
__label__1	Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
__label__2	A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .
__label__3	A Lifetime movie about men .
__label__3	The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .
__label__2	It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?
__label__3	It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
__label__2	This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
__label__2	The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .
__label__2	I think it was Plato who said , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
__label__2	If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .
__label__2	This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .
__label__1	Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .
__label__1	I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
__label__3	This is more a case of ` Sacre bleu ! '
__label__3	than ` Magnifique ' .
__label__2	The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
__label__1	Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .
__label__1	But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
__label__3	Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .
__label__4	I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
__label__3	Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?
__label__1	is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
__label__3	Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
__label__2	This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
__label__1	Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
__label__3	Who is this movie for ?
__label__3	Not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance .
__label__1	It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
__label__1	A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
__label__2	It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .
__label__2	Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''
__label__2	The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
__label__1	It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
__label__2	Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
__label__2	Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
__label__1	For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
__label__1	A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
__label__2	Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .
__label__4	Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
__label__2	Originality is sorely lacking .
__label__3	The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .
__label__5	But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
__label__2	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .
__label__3	Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .
__label__3	Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .
__label__1	For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '
__label__2	There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
__label__2	Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .
__label__1	I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .
__label__2	It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
__label__2	( I ) t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .
__label__2	Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
__label__3	Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .
__label__3	` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .
__label__1	Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
__label__2	Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .
__label__2	The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .
__label__2	It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
__label__1	This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
__label__2	Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .
__label__1	Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
__label__2	Every note rings false .
__label__2	When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
__label__2	It never rises to its clever what-if concept .
__label__3	Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
__label__2	This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .
__label__2	This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .
__label__1	The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
__label__2	About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
__label__2	A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .
__label__1	( Less a movie than ) an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment .
__label__4	The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .
__label__3	It 's too bad nothing else is .
__label__3	Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
__label__2	El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .
__label__4	Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen
__label__5	A serious movie with serious ideas .
__label__2	But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
__label__2	There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .
__label__2	The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
__label__2	I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
__label__2	What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
__label__2	( A ) painfully flat gross-out comedy ...
__label__1	Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .
__label__3	The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
__label__2	It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
__label__2	I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .
__label__1	The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
__label__2	The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
__label__2	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential .
__label__2	There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
__label__2	It drowns in sap .
__label__4	Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
__label__2	It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
__label__2	I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
__label__2	There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .
__label__3	The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list .
__label__2	The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
__label__5	Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling ( Murder by Numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative .
__label__2	It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
__label__2	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
__label__2	Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .
__label__3	Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .
__label__2	The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .
__label__2	With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .
__label__3	Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .
__label__2	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
__label__2	A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
__label__2	The material and the production itself are little more than routine .
__label__2	The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
__label__1	Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
__label__1	It 's all surface psychodramatics .
__label__2	The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .
__label__2	That frenetic spectacle ( on the TV show ) has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout .
__label__1	Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
__label__2	For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .
__label__2	Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
__label__2	Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
__label__1	An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
__label__1	too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .
__label__2	There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .
__label__3	A wordy wisp of a comedy .
__label__2	Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
__label__2	( Seagal 's ) strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie .
__label__1	Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .
__label__2	A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
__label__1	Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .
__label__3	A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .
__label__1	The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .
__label__1	Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it .
__label__3	I realized that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked , its story was making no sense at all .
__label__2	It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
__label__2	Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .
__label__2	SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .
__label__3	After all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .
__label__2	Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .
__label__5	It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
__label__3	If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .
__label__2	Suffers from a flat script and a low budget .
__label__4	There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door .
__label__3	The same should go for movie theaters .
__label__1	Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .
__label__3	The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
__label__3	As it stands it 's an opera movie for the buffs .
__label__1	This franchise has not spawned a single good film .
__label__1	The crap continues .
__label__2	Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock ( since Sept. 11 ) .
__label__4	High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .
__label__2	Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .
__label__2	One big blustery movie where nothing really happens .
__label__1	When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .
__label__2	Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
__label__2	The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
__label__3	Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .
__label__3	As it stands , there 's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more .
__label__2	I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .
__label__3	The picture does n't know it 's a comedy .
