__label__2	While it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
__label__2	Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .
__label__3	Yes they can swim , the title is merely Anne-Sophie Birot 's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through .
__label__3	Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for Seagal ) .
__label__3	Slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious .
__label__1	The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .
__label__1	In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24/7 .
__label__2	For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets ( sci-fi ) rehash .
__label__1	A thriller without a lot of thrills .
__label__1	This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .
__label__3	Ah , the travails of metropolitan life !
__label__3	Alas , another breathless movie about same !
__label__3	In Moonlight Mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle .
__label__3	Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .
__label__1	Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .
__label__2	Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
__label__2	Slap her - she 's not funny !
__label__1	No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
__label__4	Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
__label__2	`` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? ''
__label__2	Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
__label__3	`` Not really as bad as you might think ! ''
__label__3	Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .
__label__5	One regards Reign of Fire with awe .
__label__3	What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .
__label__3	It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
__label__2	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .
__label__4	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
__label__3	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
__label__2	I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD .
__label__1	An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .
__label__3	Ninety minutes of Viva Castro !
__label__2	can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included
__label__1	Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .
__label__2	It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
__label__3	In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time .
__label__2	... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''
__label__1	Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
__label__2	Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) .
__label__2	It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
__label__3	None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .
__label__2	The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
__label__2	A great script brought down by lousy direction .
__label__3	Same guy with both hats .
__label__2	Big mistake .
__label__2	A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .
__label__3	Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` Miami Vice '' checklist of power boats , Latin music and dog tracks .
__label__2	He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .
__label__3	In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
__label__3	The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .
__label__2	Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .
__label__4	According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .
__label__4	An encouraging effort from McCrudden
__label__2	The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .
__label__1	If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .
__label__3	Fortunately , you still have that option .
__label__2	Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
__label__2	Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
__label__2	To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...
__label__2	A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
__label__2	This u-boat does n't have a captain .
__label__2	With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , ( Crane ) becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
__label__1	This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .
__label__1	Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
__label__2	I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .
__label__2	Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .
__label__1	After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .
__label__3	A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .
__label__1	The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
__label__1	But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
__label__3	Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .
__label__2	As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .
__label__1	... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .
__label__2	Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .
__label__3	It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
__label__2	The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
__label__3	The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '
__label__2	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
__label__2	Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
__label__2	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .
__label__2	What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
__label__2	A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .
__label__2	little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
__label__3	The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .
__label__1	The Master of Disguise is awful .
__label__1	It 's Pauly Shore awful .
__label__2	Do n't say you were n't warned .
__label__2	Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter .
__label__3	The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
__label__2	` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .
__label__4	What ( Frei ) gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .
__label__2	An ugly , revolting movie .
__label__2	The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .
__label__1	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
__label__2	Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .
__label__1	You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
__label__3	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .
__label__1	It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
__label__2	The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?
__label__1	From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
__label__2	My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
__label__3	A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .
__label__2	Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
__label__3	directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
__label__3	The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .
__label__2	An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
__label__2	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
__label__3	Harvard Man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality .
__label__3	Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .
__label__1	Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
__label__3	While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere .
__label__3	The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .
__label__2	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
__label__2	Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .
__label__2	Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
__label__2	This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .
__label__2	Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .
__label__2	Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .
__label__1	The film is all over the place , really .
__label__2	It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
__label__3	The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
__label__2	The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .
__label__1	Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
__label__2	When ( Reno ) lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .
__label__2	Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
__label__1	Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
__label__2	While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
__label__1	Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
__label__2	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .
__label__1	It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
__label__1	And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
__label__2	The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .
__label__3	The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .
__label__1	Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
__label__1	The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
__label__3	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .
__label__2	The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
__label__2	It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
__label__2	All mood and no movie .
__label__1	Press the delete key .
__label__4	Simone is not a bad film .
__label__2	It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
__label__2	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
__label__3	... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .
__label__2	Wait to see it then .
__label__1	There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
__label__3	Or for the year , for that matter .
__label__1	Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
__label__1	This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
__label__2	Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .
__label__2	Over and over again .
__label__1	The threat implied in the title Pokémon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
__label__2	The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
__label__1	To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
__label__3	Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .
__label__2	The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
__label__4	By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .
__label__3	Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .
__label__2	It 's not an easy one to review .
__label__2	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .
__label__2	But it would be better to wait for the video .
__label__3	And a very rainy day .
__label__2	The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
__label__4	Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
__label__3	Would n't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II ?
__label__3	Um , no. .
__label__2	But here 's a movie about it anyway .
__label__3	Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
__label__2	The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
__label__3	But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .
__label__3	Mushes the college-friends genre ( The Big Chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .
__label__3	Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .
__label__4	Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
__label__1	But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
__label__2	A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
__label__4	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
__label__1	Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
__label__1	It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
__label__2	Woody , what happened ?
__label__4	Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .
__label__1	It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
__label__2	You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell .
__label__2	Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?
__label__2	Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
__label__3	Routine and rather silly .
__label__1	A rip-off twice removed , modeled after ( Seagal 's ) earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
__label__1	Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
__label__1	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
__label__2	Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
__label__3	While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
__label__1	Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
__label__1	If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
__label__2	If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
__label__3	A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .
__label__2	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?
__label__2	On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
__label__1	The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
__label__2	More trifle than triumph .
__label__1	The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
__label__1	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
__label__2	Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
__label__2	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
__label__2	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
__label__2	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .
__label__1	Does n't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) .
__label__1	The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
__label__3	As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f *** ed ' .
__label__4	Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
__label__2	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
__label__2	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
__label__3	A well-acted , but one-note film .
__label__2	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .
__label__2	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
__label__1	( Lee ) treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
__label__4	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
__label__1	There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
__label__1	No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
__label__2	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
__label__2	Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
__label__3	The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
__label__2	Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
__label__2	Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel ( About Schmidt ) and an old Payne screenplay .
__label__4	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
__label__1	We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
__label__2	Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
__label__2	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
__label__1	Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
__label__1	When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
__label__2	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
__label__1	Marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
__label__2	Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
__label__1	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
__label__2	( A ) boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
__label__2	Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
__label__1	Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
__label__2	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
__label__1	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
__label__2	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
__label__2	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
__label__2	Shame on writer/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
__label__3	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .
__label__2	Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
__label__2	Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
__label__1	With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
__label__2	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
__label__3	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?
__label__3	When the violence actually shocked ?
__label__3	When the heroes were actually under 40 ?
__label__2	Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
__label__2	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
__label__1	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .
__label__1	What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
__label__1	In other words , it 's badder than bad .
__label__2	If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .
__label__2	A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .
__label__2	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
__label__2	Where the film falters is in its tone .
__label__2	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
__label__2	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
__label__3	It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
__label__1	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
__label__3	Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .
__label__1	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
__label__3	An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .
__label__1	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
__label__3	A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
__label__1	It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
__label__4	Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
__label__2	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .
__label__2	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
__label__2	The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
__label__1	It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up .
__label__2	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
__label__3	in period costume and with a bigger budget .
__label__4	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
__label__1	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
__label__2	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
__label__3	A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
__label__1	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
__label__1	If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel ( or Robert Aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliché .
__label__1	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
__label__2	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
__label__3	Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
__label__1	` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
__label__2	The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
__label__2	Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
__label__2	It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
__label__3	Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .
__label__3	Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it 's anti-Catholic .
__label__1	Hate it because it 's lousy .
__label__2	... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
__label__1	Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
__label__2	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
__label__4	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
__label__2	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
__label__2	Not just unlikable .
__label__2	Disturbing .
__label__1	Disgusting .
__label__1	Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
__label__1	This thing is virtually unwatchable .
__label__4	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
__label__1	Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
__label__2	The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .
__label__4	The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .
__label__1	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
__label__1	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
__label__1	Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
__label__2	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
__label__1	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
__label__3	A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
__label__2	The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
__label__3	Spy-vs .
__label__1	- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
__label__1	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
__label__3	The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .
__label__2	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .
__label__2	An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
__label__4	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
__label__2	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
__label__2	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
__label__1	Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
__label__2	The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
__label__3	Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .
__label__3	A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .
__label__2	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
__label__3	Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .
__label__3	An extraordinarily silly thriller .
__label__2	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
__label__1	Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
__label__2	Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
__label__2	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of ( Godard 's ) vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
__label__4	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
__label__2	The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
__label__2	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
__label__1	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
__label__1	No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
__label__4	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
__label__2	The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
__label__2	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
__label__2	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
__label__2	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
__label__1	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
__label__2	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
__label__3	This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of Amélie .
__label__2	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
__label__3	Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .
__label__3	If there ai n't none , you have a problem .
__label__2	The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
__label__3	Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .
__label__1	Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
__label__2	Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
__label__2	More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
__label__1	Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
__label__2	It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
__label__1	Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
__label__1	A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
__label__2	The drama discloses almost nothing .
__label__2	A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
__label__2	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
__label__2	As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
__label__1	A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
__label__3	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .
__label__3	And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .
__label__2	Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
__label__3	It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
__label__3	It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
__label__5	The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
__label__3	But it does n't need Gangs of New York .
__label__3	Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with Cage 's best acting .
__label__3	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .
__label__3	It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
__label__1	Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
__label__2	( Lin Chung 's ) voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this Western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
__label__2	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
__label__2	Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
__label__1	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
__label__2	Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
__label__1	It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
__label__2	Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
__label__2	... a rather bland affair .
__label__3	Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .
__label__3	The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
__label__3	I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .
__label__3	Harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .
__label__1	Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
__label__2	A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
__label__1	All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
__label__2	The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
__label__2	Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world .
__label__4	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
__label__2	It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
__label__2	I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
__label__1	If you go , pack your knitting needles .
__label__1	The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
__label__2	We do n't even like their characters .
__label__1	Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
__label__2	The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
__label__1	It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
__label__2	This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
__label__2	Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
__label__2	It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
__label__1	A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
__label__1	The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
__label__1	Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
__label__2	Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
__label__2	Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
__label__3	Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .
__label__2	Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
__label__1	Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
__label__2	The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
__label__2	You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
__label__2	I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
__label__2	Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
__label__2	The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
__label__1	Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
__label__3	an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? ''
__label__4	- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
__label__2	A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
__label__1	An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
__label__1	... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
__label__1	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
__label__2	An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
__label__3	A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .
__label__2	One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
__label__3	Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
__label__2	A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .
__label__1	( Hell is ) looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
__label__2	Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
__label__2	Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
__label__3	... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .
__label__1	Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
__label__2	The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
__label__1	You have no affinity for most of the characters .
__label__2	Nothing about them is attractive .
__label__2	What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
__label__4	Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
__label__3	A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .
__label__1	An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
__label__2	It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
__label__3	Absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying .
__label__3	Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .
__label__2	Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .
__label__2	No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
__label__1	You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
__label__2	` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
__label__3	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
__label__3	Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
__label__3	Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda .
__label__1	Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
__label__1	How about surprising us by trying something new ?
__label__1	Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
__label__2	Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
__label__3	If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
__label__1	Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
__label__1	You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
__label__3	The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
__label__3	This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
__label__1	A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
__label__3	Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
__label__2	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
__label__2	Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
__label__3	One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .
__label__1	Too bad none of it is funny .
__label__3	The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
__label__2	The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
__label__3	The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
__label__2	Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
__label__4	Oh , and more entertaining , too .
__label__1	... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
__label__3	Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
__label__2	Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
__label__2	The film is strictly routine .
__label__3	Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
__label__3	While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .
__label__1	In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
__label__3	It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
__label__3	The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .
__label__1	You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
__label__2	Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
__label__3	If you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in Anne Geddes , John Grisham , and Thomas Kincaid .
__label__2	We get the comedy we settle for .
__label__2	The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
__label__3	Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
__label__1	A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
__label__2	And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
__label__4	The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
__label__2	Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
__label__2	The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
__label__2	Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
__label__1	Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
__label__2	All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
__label__3	Hey Arnold !
__label__3	is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .
__label__4	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
__label__2	True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
__label__1	Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
__label__1	The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
__label__2	Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
__label__3	The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
__label__2	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
__label__2	It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
__label__2	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
__label__1	... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
__label__2	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
__label__2	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
__label__3	In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
__label__1	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
__label__3	You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
__label__2	The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
__label__2	This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
__label__1	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
__label__3	the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .
__label__2	That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
__label__2	It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
__label__1	If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
__label__2	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
__label__1	It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
__label__1	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
__label__1	As pedestrian as they come .
__label__2	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
__label__1	It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
__label__3	Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .
__label__2	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
__label__2	An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
__label__2	The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
__label__2	As saccharine as it is disposable .
__label__2	You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
__label__2	The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
__label__1	Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
__label__2	Too much power , not enough puff .
__label__1	The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
__label__2	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
__label__1	A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
__label__3	Muddled , trashy and incompetent
__label__2	For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
__label__2	Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
__label__3	Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
__label__2	Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
__label__1	It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
__label__2	his ( Nelson 's ) screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
__label__2	It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
__label__1	A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
__label__1	There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
__label__2	As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
__label__3	The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
__label__2	Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
__label__4	`` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...
__label__5	One of the best , most understated performances of ( Jack Nicholson 's ) career .
__label__4	The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true .
__label__5	It 's a masterpiece .
__label__3	It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
__label__2	They crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
__label__4	And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
__label__3	Charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie .
__label__5	Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
__label__3	A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
__label__4	By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
__label__4	Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
__label__4	` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
__label__4	The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
__label__4	As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .
__label__5	Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
__label__4	Catch it ... if you can !
__label__3	Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '
__label__2	American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
__label__4	` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
__label__5	It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
__label__4	Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
__label__4	The script is smart , not cloying .
__label__4	Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .
__label__5	A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
__label__5	One fantastic ( and educational ) documentary .
__label__4	An ambitious ` what if ? '
__label__4	that works .
__label__4	`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
__label__4	Nice piece of work .
__label__4	` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
__label__4	It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
__label__4	Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
__label__3	The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
__label__4	From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
__label__5	Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .

__label__3	Is `` Ballistic '' worth the price of admission ?
__label__2	Absolutely not .
__label__1	It sucked .
__label__3	Would I see it again ?
__label__3	Please see previous answer .

__label__2	A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
__label__3	The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
__label__2	This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
__label__1	What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
